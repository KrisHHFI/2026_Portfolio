## Intro

I made a new portfolio site to showcase my **photography**, **coding**, and **design** work.  
The project emphasizes accessibility, security, and clean, maintainable code.

---

## AI

### Test Writing

- GitHub Copilot was used to assist in writing tests and achieving high code coverage.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Controls

The site supports full keyboard navigation, ensuring smooth and accessible interactions for users who rely on keyboard input.

**Desktop experience:**

### Mobile Accessibility

- The carousel supports natural swipe gestures on mobile devices.
- The layout is fully responsive across mobile portrait/landscape, tablets, and widescreen displays.

## Security

### Security Headers

- Security headers are implemented to help mitigate common web-based threats.

### Sign-in

- Due to the risk of AI misuse of facial data, subjects’ faces are censored by default.
- Uncensored images are protected behind a sign-in feature.
